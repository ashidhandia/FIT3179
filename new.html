        <p>With changing times, AI has swiftly integrated into our daily lives. Be it the virtual assistant on our phones
            or generative AI taking the world by storm, artificial intelligence has come a long way. However, with each
            achievement, there are costs and sacrifices. What exactly is the cost of artificial intelligence?</p>

                There are winners and losers for each achievement that comes our way. The AI industry is thriving and reaching never attained heights, but are there any sacrifices made for this meteoric rise? What exactly is the cost of artificial intelligence? The gains are visible, but what have we lost?

                The 60s had the nuclear arms race where the major superpowers were competing in increasing their nuclear arsenals through rigorous research and high volumes of investment. The 21st century is now seeing its own version of the arms race with artificial intelligence. Countries have devoted trillions of dollars towards AI development and research to harness the true potential of artificial intelligence for boosting economic growth and technological advancement. According to OurWorldInData, the United States alone invested around 150 billion dollars in 2021. For comparison, this is equivalent to the entire GDP of Morocco. 68 governments around the world recorded a mind-blowing number of patents in the artificial intelligence industry at around 94,000 patent applications submitted. This indicates a positive return from the investments.
