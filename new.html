        <p>With changing times, AI has swiftly integrated into our daily lives. Be it the virtual assistant on our phones
            or generative AI taking the world by storm, artificial intelligence has come a long way. However, with each
            achievement, there are costs and sacrifices. What exactly is the cost of artificial intelligence?</p>

                According to the research by 
                <a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2104/2104.10350.pdf" class="custom-link">Patterson et al. (2021)</a>, 
                the average energy consumption can be calculated through a set formula. It depends heavily on the 
                <span class="highlight">number of parameters</span>, as the more parameters there are, the longer and more 
                intensive the training process becomes:<br>
                <span class="formula-inline">Energy (kWh) = Hours to train × Number of processors × Average power per processor (kW) × 1000 ÷ PUE</span>.
                <br>The formula highlights how various factors such as training duration, the number of processors, and 
                the power consumption of each processor contribute to the overall energy demand of training AI models.

                This overuse of electricity is certainly h2rmful which brings us to the concept of Earth Overshoot Day.
Earth Overshoot Day marks the point in the year when humanity has consumed more resources than the Earth can regenerate in that same year. Since the late 1970s, this day has crept earlier and earlier on the calendar, signaling an unsustainable strain on the planet's resources. In 2023, it fell on August 2nd, demonstrating that we are consuming 75% more than what Earth's ecosystems can replenish.
The Global Footprint Network introduced this concept in the 1990s to highlight the growing demand humans place on natural capital. Currently, we are using the resources of 1.75 Earths to sustain our consumption, meaning we overshoot Earth's capacity long before the year ends.
aLONgside this excessive usage and our planet’s inability to keep up, we are further damaging the planet’s various ecosystems through our carbon emissions. Training ai models has a monstrous carbon footprint compared to what an average human can emit upto.
